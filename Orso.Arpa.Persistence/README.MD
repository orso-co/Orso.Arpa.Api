## Database

MS SQL Server is used. If you run the app locally, the LocalDB is used by default. Consider changing the connection string in the `appsettings.Development.json` file if no LocalDB is available. The appsettings file can be found in the Orso.Arpa.Api project.

## Entity Framework Migrations
Use a command line or terminal window to run these commands. If you are using Visual Studio consider using the built-in Package Manager Console. Install globally the dotnet ef tools: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`

### Add New Migration
```
dotnet ef migrations add "<NameOfMigration>" -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
```

### Remove Last Migration
In case a formerly added migration needs to be revoked, ensure to have revoked *EntityTypeConfigurations* to the point of
time, where the errorneous add was issued. Then run the *remove* command.
```
dotnet ef migrations remove -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
```

### Update Database
```
dotnet ef database update -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
```
In case you need to downgrade your database to a former migration,

1. obtain then list of migration names
    ```
    dotnet ef migrations list -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
    ```
1. downgrade to a selected migration
    ```
    dotnet ef database update "<NameOfMigration>" -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
    ```


Hint: The database is updated automatically to the most recent migration at app start. Only use this command if you want to update the database without starting the app.
