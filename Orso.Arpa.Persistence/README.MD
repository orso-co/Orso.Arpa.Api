## Database

MS SQL Server is used. If you run the app locally, the LocalDB is used by default. Consider changing the connection string in the `appsettings.Development.json` file if no LocalDB is available. The appsettings file can be found in the Orso.Arpa.Api project.

## Entity Framework Migrations
Use a command line or terminal window to run these commands. If you are using Visual Studio consider using the built-in Package Manager Console. Install globally the dotnet ef tools: `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`

dotnet ef migrations add "<NameOfMigration>" -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
```

### Update Database

dotnet ef database update -s Orso.Arpa.Api/ -p Orso.Arpa.Persistence/
```

Hint: The database is updated automatically at app start. Only use this command if you want to update the database without starting the app.
